# Isomorphic strings in C

This program was made to check whether two given strings are isomorphic.
Once you download the repo you can simply run the executable "RunTests.exe" to 
see the program in action. If you want to recompile it you must have the GCC compiler,
which can be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/) and use the command 
"gcc isostrings.c isotests.c -o RunTests".
